    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

    "as you have complete, full knowledge of your population. In other words, your sample _is_ your population. It's worth noting that we're dealing with what Professor Spiegehalter describes on p. 92 of *AoS* as a **metaphorical population**: we have all the data, and we act as if the data-point is taken from a population at random. We can think of this population as an imaginary space of possibilities. \n",

    "If, however, you have sampled _from_ your population, you only have partial knowledge of the state of your population. In this case, the standard deviation of your sample is not an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation of the population, in which case you seek to estimate that population parameter via the sample standard deviation, which uses the $n-1$ denominator."

    "So far we've been dealing with the concept of taking a sample from a population to infer the population parameters. One statistic we calculated for a sample was the mean. As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. **The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases (the intuitions behind the CLT are covered in full on p. 236 of *AoS*). For the sampling distribution of the mean, the standard deviation of this distribution is given by\n",

    "This is important because typically we are dealing with samples from populations and all we know about the population is what we see in the sample. From this sample, we want to make inferences about the population. We may do this, for example, by looking at the histogram of the values and by calculating the mean and standard deviation (as estimates of the population parameters), and so we are intrinsically interested in how these quantities vary across samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, now that we've taken one sample of size $n$ and made some claims about the general population, what if we were to take another sample of size $n$? Would we get the same result? Would we make the same claims about the general population? This brings us to a fundamental question: _when we make some inference about a population based on our sample, how confident can we be that we've got it 'right'?_\n",

    "Now, the standard normal distribution (with its variance equal to its standard deviation of one) would not be a great illustration of a key point. Instead, let's imagine we live in a town of 50,000 people and we know the height of everyone in this town. We will have 50,000 numbers that tell us everything about our population. We'll simulate these numbers now and put ourselves in one particular town, called 'town 47', where the population mean height is 172 cm and population standard deviation is 5 cm."

We've been sampling from a population we know is normally distributed, we've come to understand when to use $n$ and when to use $n-1$ in the denominator to calculate the spread of a distribution, and we've  seen the Central Limit Theorem in action for a sampling distribution. All seems very well behaved in Frequentist land. But, well, why should we really care?"

If we want to make inferences to conclusions like \"this observation is unusual\" or \"my population mean has changed\" then we need to have some idea of what the underlying distribution is so we can calculate relevant probabilities. In frequentist inference, we use the formulae above to deduce these population parameters. Take a moment in the next part of this assignment to refresh your understanding of how these probabilities work."

Hint: you may find it helpful to sketch the standard normal distribution (the familiar bell shape) and mark the number of standard deviations from the mean on the x-axis and shade the regions of the curve that contain certain percentages of the population."

    "Calculating this probability involved calculating the area under the curve from the value of 1 and below. To put it in mathematical terms, we need to *integrate* the probability density function. We could just add together the known areas of chunks (from -Inf to 0 and then 0 to $+\\sigma$ in the example above). One way to do this is to look up tables (literally). Fortunately, scipy has this functionality built in with the cdf() function."

We remind ourselves that another result from the CLT is that _even if the underlying population distribution is not normal, the sampling distribution will tend to become normal with sufficiently large sample size_. (**Check out p. 199 of AoS if you need to revise this**). This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places. In reality this is simply a rule of thumb; if the underlying distribution is approximately normal then your sampling distribution will already be pretty normal, but if the underlying distribution is heavily skewed then you'd want to increase your sample size."
